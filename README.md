<h1>GenioPay Test</h1>

This is a simple app that showcases built UIs provided by GenioPay for a technical challenge.

The motivation for building this application is to showcase my Flutter skills building custom UIs.

<h1>Getting started</h1>

- To test on iOS devices, ensure that you are using a macOS system to build and run the app properly.

- Check if you have an Integrated Development Environment with Flutter enabled (such as Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, etc.) installed properly on your machine.

- Open a terminal and run <code>git -v</code> to check if Git is set up.

- On the same terminal, run <code>flutter doctor</code> to see whether Flutter is installed and configured properly on your system. If not, you can follow the step-by-step documentation <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started">here</a>.

- Clone the repository through the CLI (<code>git clone https://github.com/Dev4LifeV/search_and_stay_test</code>) or through <a href="x-github-client://openRepo/https://github.com/Dev4LifeV/search_and_stay_test">GitHub Desktop</a> and place it in your favorite directory.

- Open your IDE and locate the project folder.

- Then, start the project by selecting which system (iOS or Android device) you want to build and run through your IDE.
